This project includes a multi-agent team that automates the process of programming, tuning, and training Tensorflow classification models.

To ensure that the most up-to-date syntax is used, agents are given access to the Tavily Tool to search for techniques and strategies on how to develop the best possible model.

Agents are also given access to the "inspect_dir" tool to find out how many classes are being classified, along with the dimensions of the images being used. This allows the model to properly tune loss functions and activation functions (sigmoid vs softmax, categorical crossentropy vs binary crossentropy loss)

To ensure that this process is fully automated the agents are also given access to the console, giving them the ability to save and run the python scripts they generate.

The workflow of the agent team can be seen below:
